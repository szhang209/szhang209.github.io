    <h1>Elden Ring</h1>
    <p>
        What I find interesting about Elden Ring is how they allow players to 
        <strong>freely roam</strong> and discover bits and pieces about the world 
        at their own pace. I also like that there are so many <strong>weapon combinations</strong> 
        and viable tactics you can use in order to defeat and play the game. The graphics 
        are amazing and the combat feels satisfying. The map design is also well thought 
        out and contains many hidden secrets to find.
